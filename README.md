libpcap is a very popular user-space networking library, with which you can capture and or generate packets. libpcap is the underlying framework for many popular packet capture tools such as tcpdump, Wireshark and so on. In fact libpcap is a part of tcpdump project. But besides just using it as a packet capture tool, you can use libpcap in various applications, such as user-space based networking stack development, etc. In some cases libpcap is yet another alternative to raw-sockets and tun/tap interfaces.

Disclaimer: This code is based on GitHub libpcap example code published by the author Taehun Kim. Which has been used as a live example in my YouTube video episode as a sample to demonstrate working example sample libpcap user-space C code. So I modified few parts so that viewers can get an idea how to utilize libpcap framework interms of developing their own user-space network stack based on libpcap library. Here is the GitHub project link: https://gist.github.com/Taehun/2502332
