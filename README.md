libpcap is a very popular user-space networking library, with which you can capture and or generate packets. libpcap is the underlying framework for many popular packet capture tools such as tcpdump, Wireshark and so on. In fact libpcap is a part of tcpdump project. But besides just using it as a packet capture tool, you can use libpcap in various applications, such as user-space based networking stack development, etc. In some cases libpcap is yet another alternative to raw-sockets and tun/tap interfaces.
